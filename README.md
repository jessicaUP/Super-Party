## SUMMARY
Super Party is a Super Mario Party Character Directory. Create by Jessica Uphoff for educational purposes. Wanting to take a spin an a employee directory, I decided to tailor it from an employee to a character directory.

## EXPLORE
The Explore character index acts as a landing page and additional navigation. Once a character show page has been visited, the image of the character in the Explore section will be in color!
To access the Explore index again, simply click on the Nintendo logo.

## CHARACTER INDEX
The main character navigation is located on the show page. The user can easily scroll through all of the options

## CHARACTER SHOW
The current character is stored in the store and will adjust the component based off the clicked index tile. (Edge Case: if a user exits the explore page without selecting a character, Mario is selected). The Character 'jobs' are located at the top.
